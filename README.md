# Description
Quickly search the web with variables inside the query for those pesky repeating lookups.
When researching, troubleshooting or working in general one tends to repeat very similar queries in order to give the search engine enough context. 

For example, I often need to lookup function definitions for programming languages so I have to retype the name of the language followed by the actual query. Every. Time. This really does get tedious after a while.

"Javascript reduce", "Javascript sort", "Javascr... \*sigh\*"...

This extension saves you those pesky, pesky keystrokes!

Define your own variables to fit your needs and speed up your queries. Need to retype IDs of components often? Need to often retype multiple keywords? Need to retype specific dates? Create variables for them and enjoy the pure bliss of searching efficiently!

### Note:
I noticed that adblockers may block the assets because their names include the word `ad` which is annoying. Whitelist those resources if you want to see them. TODO: Remove this line when you change the filenames.
